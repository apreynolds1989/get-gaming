### What is it?
---
Get Gaming serves as an information page for Board Game nights to be hosted in partnership with Get Coding for Networking events. It provides information for an Upcoming Event, showcasing the games that will be featured at the event. It also provides a Library of Games available for future events, a Gallery of images from past events and a Contact Form to ask questions/get more detailed information.

### Why Make it?
---
As an avid Board Gamer, I thought Board Game Nights would make for great Networking opportunities for myself (and my fellow students) as I make the transition into the Tech sector. It provided me with an opportunity to practice with React and gave me a platform I could use to display the relevant information for Get Gaming events.

### What's Next?
---
As this is mostly a platform to simply display information for Get Gaming events, it can be considered mostly complete. The Library can continue to be upated as my Board Game collection changes. New photos can be added to the Gallery.

Features I may consider in the future include:
- As this was the first project I have built with React the code is a little messy and unorganzied, I plan to take the time to clean up the code base
- User database which would allow users to internally rate games to give an idea of how the local community feels about each game
